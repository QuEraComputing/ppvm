# Orbit-preserving Trotter vs expm comparison (2026-07-03)

Goal: compare Trotter vs expm in the ORBIT-PRESERVING (translation-symmetry /
momentum-k) representation, precision-matched at rel~1e-3, on an example with
~1M final basis. For expm, compare stream vs cache (leakage) with a max_basis cut.
Scan dt and drop_tol for both.

## Stage 0 (DONE): foundation verified vs exact ED (N=8 XY chain, k=1)
Both orbit-preserving methods reproduce the exact momentum-k autocorrelation
C_k(t) = <O_k, e^{tL}O_k>/<O_k,O_k>, O_k = sum_j e^{-2pi i k j/N} Z_j:
- expm orbit-rep (pc_step_orbit_rep, complex coeffs) == exact (to ~1e-4).
- Trotter symmetry-merged (real-pair PauliSum + momentum_merge) == exact
  (real part ~1e-4; tiny O(dt^2) equivariance drift in imag).
KEY API notes learned:
- expm: seed = k-mode Z (basis Z_j, coeffs e^{-i phi j}); project via
  canonicalize_basis_arr_complex(basis,coeffs,group,mom); evolve
  pc_step_orbit_rep(basis,coeffs,dt,max_basis,group,mom,drop,protected).
  TranslationGroup.chain_1d(N), mom=[k]. C_k via overlap with the seed reps.
- Trotter: keep O_k as a REAL PAIR (R=sum cos(phi j)Z_j, Im=sum -sin(phi j)Z_j);
  apply the SAME real gates to both; R.momentum_merge(Im,group,mom) folds to
  orbit-rep. GATE ANGLE = 2*c*dt (Rxx=e^{-i th/2 XX}, H coeff c=1) -- using dt
  (not 2dt) decays ~4x too slow. C_k via PauliSum.overlap:
  <A+iB,C+iD> = (<A,C>+<B,D>) + i(<A,D>-<B,C>), norm = <R,R>+<Im,Im> = N.
Harnesses: orbit_verify.py (expm), trotter_orbit_verify.py (Trotter).

## Remaining stages
1. Add orbit-rep STREAMING (matrix-free) to orbit_rep.rs (PPVM_EXPM_STREAM does
   NOT reach it -- it has its own build_orbit_rep_cols/OrbitRepCscOp). Needed for
   the expm stream-vs-cache comparison in the orbit-preserving case.
2. Scale to ~1M orbit-rep basis: large-N chain (orbit-rep basis ~ full/|G|), long
   enough T. No exact ED at that scale -> converged reference (tightest drop/dt).
3. Scan dt x drop_tol for BOTH methods; match rel~1e-3; compare wall + PEAK RSS.
   For expm: stream vs cache (leakage), both with a max_basis cut.
